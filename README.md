# EmbeddedSystemsLab1
Objective:
The objective of this lab is to learn the basics of connecting hardware to a web front using a raspberry pi. To learn these principles, the lab requires:
Create a state machine to figure out how the LED lights can connect to the pi and light up.
Connect the lights to your pi using GPIO pins and output. 
Install a webserver through your pi to host a user interface for the lights.
Set up a program to run that allows a user to control the lights on the breadboard.
